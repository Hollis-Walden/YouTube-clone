# YouTube-clone
This is a YouTube clone I created to challenge my ability to recreate something with code simply by looking at a visual representation of it. 

## My Goals:
* Use HTML and CSS to recreate the YouTube homepage
* Give the videos functionailty

## My Process
I started with HTML to get the basic structure going. I then used CSS to recreate and arrange the logos and icons needed for the classic YouTube look.

## Built with
*HTML5
*CSS custom properties

## What I learned
Coding a clone can be challenging! There isn't always an obvious route to recreating what you see with what can be accomplished using CSS. 
It takes some trial and error and a good dose of patience. 

## Continued development
I enjoyed the challenge that comes with cloning. I will continue to dedicate time to strengthening my CSS knowledege and skills.
